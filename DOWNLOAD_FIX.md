# Results Download Fix

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing reportlab Library
**Problem:** The `reportlab` library was not installed, causing PDF downloads to fail with 500 errors.

**Solution:** Added `reportlab>=4.0.0` to `requirements.txt` and installed it.

### 2. Poor Error Handling in Frontend
**Problem:** Download errors were not being displayed clearly to users.

**Solution:** Enhanced the download function in `AdminResults.jsx` with:
- Validation of exam IDs before making requests
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- Console logging for debugging
- Proper handling of blob response errors

### 3. Invalid Exam ID in URL
**Problem:** The URL had `exam=3T` instead of a numeric exam ID, causing 404 errors.

**Solution:** The improved error handling now validates exam IDs and shows clear error messages.

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Restart the Django Server
The server needs to be restarted to load the newly installed `reportlab` library.

**In the terminal running the Django server:**
1. Press `CTRL+BREAK` (or `CTRL+C`) to stop the server
2. Restart it with: `python manage.py runserver`

### Step 2: Test CSV Download
1. Navigate to the Results page: http://localhost:5173/admin/results
2. Select a grade (e.g., "Grade 7")
3. Select an exam from the dropdown
4. Click "Download CSV"
5. The CSV file should download successfully

### Step 3: Test PDF Download
1. On the same page with an exam selected
2. Click "Download PDF"
3. The PDF file should download successfully

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Download
- File downloads automatically
- No error messages appear
- Console shows: "Download initiated successfully"

### Failed Download
- Clear error message appears in red box
- Console shows detailed error information
- Error message indicates the specific problem:
  - "Invalid exam ID" - if exam ID is not numeric
  - "Exam not found" - if exam doesn't exist (404)
  - "Permission denied" - if user lacks access (403)
  - "Server error" - if backend error occurs (500)

## Current Status

✅ **CSV Downloads** - Working correctly (verified in terminal logs)
⚠️ **PDF Downloads** - Will work after server restart
✅ **Error Handling** - Improved with validation and clear messages
✅ **Dependencies** - reportlab installed and added to requirements.txt

## Notes

- The URL parameter issue (`exam=3T`) will now show a clear error message
- Users should select exams from the dropdown rather than manually editing URLs
- All download errors are now logged to the browser console for debugging
